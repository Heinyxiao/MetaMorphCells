# MetaMorphCells: Unveiling Cancer Cell Dedifferentiation
**MetaMorphCells** is a bioinformatics research project focused on studying a small population of cancer cells that undergo dedifferentiation into cancer stem cells. This repository contains various scripts and notebooks for preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing single-cell sequencing data to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer cell dedifferentiation.

## Project Overview
Cancer cells can undergo dedifferentiation, acquiring stem-like properties that enhance their ability to proliferate, resist therapies, and metastasize. This project leverages cutting-edge bioinformatics tools to investigate these processes in ovarian cancer at a single-cell resolution.

ðŸ”¬ Key Topics:
- Cancer stem cells
- Dedifferentiation
- Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
- Bioinformatics tools and workflows

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into the following sections:

  **1. Data Preprocessing**
  
  - Scripts for data cleaning and normalization of scRNA-seq datasets.
  
  **2. Analysis Pipeline**
  
  - Includes the full pipeline from clustering, differential expression, imputation, to trajectory inference.
  
  **3. Gene Regulatory Network Inference**
  
  - Tools for building gene regulatory networks and identifying key regulators.
  
  **4. Perturbation Analysis**
  
  - Scripts to model and analyze perturbations in the dedifferentiation process.
  
  **5. Visualization**
  
  - Custom visualizations for cell clusters, gene expression, and trajectories.
